Monitor your anemia status at regular period of time


Anemia-Monitoring-DeviceMonitor your anemia status at regular intervalsAnemia is a major pubic health problem affecting more than 500 million of the indian population and leading to 58 percent of maternal deaths in India. Currently many devices are available but needs a prick of blood and dedicated instruments to calculate the hemoglobin content accurately. Here we propose a non-invasive technique to periodically monitor hemoglobin content and can especially  be used to screen anemia on a regular basis in pregnant woman and children using pulse plethysmography. The device needs a single point calibration with zero subsequent screening cost. In addition device is portable and can be used in rural settings as a personal monitoring kit or can be used by a health worker.This non-invasive device works on the principle of pulse plethysmography. We have analysed the transmitted IR signal and found the standard deviation for 300 intervals, which is then calibrated against a known anemia detection technique. This one step calibration is then extrapolated to non invasively track anemia in subsequent days.In future, multiple LEDs will be integrated to remove the need for single point calibration and improve the field accuracy. The proposed non-invasive anemia detection device has good commercialization potential.
